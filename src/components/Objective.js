        As a third-year Information Systems student, I am passionate about
        harnessing data to deliver meaningful insights that drive business
        performance and informed decisions. I have hands-on experience with
        Python, R, SQL (Microsoft, PostgreSQL), MongoDB, and a solid foundation
        in data analysis and data engineering principles. I am seeking a
        data-focused internship where I can contribute to impactful projects,
        deepen my technical expertise, and grow in a collaborative and innovative
        environment.
